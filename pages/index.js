                career telling stories with &quot;samples&quot;. I&apos;ve
                chopped, repitched, reversed, resampled, repurposed and
                recombined many thousands of hours of audio in a myriad of weird
                and wonderful ways and have (at the time of writing this)
                officially released 124 songs. I&apos;ve released music on
                labels like Anjunadeep, Get Physical, and Desert Hearts, been
                featured in Vogue, Mixmag, and Billboard, and played headline
                slots at major festivals and clubs around the world. I would
                argue that I owe a significant portion of my success to the

                  While much of my music has been made by combining iPhone
                  recordings from my world travels with impomptu recordings of
                  myself or a dear friend pouring our hearts into an instrument,
                  a big passion of mine (and thus key component of my creative
                  process) has been digging for obscure, rare music to sample.
                  Whether it&apos;s by rooting through bins in dusty record
                  stores or scouring YouTube for zero-view videos of live
                  performances, something has always excited me about sampling.

                  <span className="drop-cap">T</span>o me, sampling is about
                  more than just sound - it&apos;s about imbuing your track with
                  traces of the feelings, memories, and stories that get
                  immortalized in a piece of &quot;complete&quot; music from
                  another time and place. When you sample a funk record from
                  1970s Tehran, you&apos;re not just sampling a drum beat or a
                  bass-line. You&apos;re sampling the story behind the song and
                  not just the sounds themselves. This adds a certain{" "}
                  <i>je-ne-sais-quoi</i> to a track that is difficult, if not
                  impossible, to capture by simply playing in the individual
                  parts today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since its invention decades go, sampling has been one of the
                  best ways to inject history, culture and texture into music
                  but it&apos;s been severely limited by two inconvenient
                  truths:
                </p>
                1. We can only sample what already exists.
                <br />
                2. We&apos;re at the mercy of what we can even find.

                <h2>UNTIL A.I. CAME ALONG.</h2>
                <p>
                  <span className="drop-cap">I</span>n early 2023, I discovered
                  technology that allowed me to <i>generate</i> samples based
                  off of descriptions - in natural language - of the kinds of
                  genres, feelings, and textures I would hunt for in samples. I
                  could craft prompts that combined different musical
                  traditions, eras, and emotional qualities, I could explore
                  sonic territories that had never existed before. These tools
                  became a gateway to discovering entirely new musical
                  possibilities. The limitation of only being able to sample
                  what existed was suddenly lifted. A new frontier of creative
                  possibility had opened up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then I&apos;ve been excitedly exploring how AI can
                  enhance my creative process; not as a shortcut or a
                  replacement for my artistic expression, but as a way to push
                  the boundaries of what I&apos;d known to be possible through
                  sampling. I&apos;ve developed an innovative - but incredibly
                  intuitive - approach that combines AI&apos;s rapidly evolving
                  capabilities with the timeless soul of what makes sampling{" "}
                  <i>human</i> music (lol) so special.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My approach isn&apos;t about pushing buttons and getting
                  instant tracks and it&apos;s definitely not about making AI
                  &quot;do the work for me&quot;. It&apos;s about fusing the
                  mind-boggling power of AI with the timeless magic of sampling
                  in a way that prioritizes authentic, human expression to
                  create beautiful music that moves people.

              your creative possibilities and speed up the ideation process.
              Think of it like having an infinitely large record collection that
              you can sample from, but one where you can describe the feelings
              or sounds you&apos;re looking for. The real magic happens when you
              combine AI-generated elements with traditional production
              techniques, treating AI outputs as raw ingredients to be shaped,
              processed, and transformed.

                  Yes - this is absolutely essential. This is not a
                  beginner&apos;s course or a &apos;quick fix&apos; solution for
                  making music. You must already be comfortable with your DAW
                  and have experience producing complete tracks. Required
                  prerequisites include: mastery of basic music theory
                  (understanding key signatures, chord progressions, and song
                  structure), proficiency with audio processing fundamentals,
                  and experience with arrangement and mixing. The course assumes
                  you already know how to make music and focuses specifically on
                  integrating AI tools into an advanced production workflow. If
                  you&apos;re new to music production, this course is not
                  suitable for you. You should first learn traditional
                  production techniques before exploring my AI integration.
