              <span class="drop-cap">H</span>owdy, I'm TÂCHES and over the last
              13 years, I've built a 70M+ stream music career telling stories
              with "samples". I've chopped, repitched, reversed, resampled,
              repurposed and recombined many thousands of hours of audio in a
              myriad of weird and wonderful ways and have (at the time of
              writing this) officially released 117 songs. I've released music
              on labels like Anjunadeep, Get Physical, and Desert Hearts, been
              featured in Vogue, Mixmag, and Billboard, and played headline
              slots at major festivals and clubs around the world. I would argue
              that I owe a significant portion of my success to the wonders of
              <b>sampling.</b>

                While much of my music has been made by combining iPhone
                recordings from my world travels with impomptu recordings of
                myself or a dear friend pouring our hearts into an instrument, a
                big passion of mine (and thus key component of my creative
                process) has been digging for obscure, rare music to sample.
                Whether it's by rooting through bins in dusty record stores or
                scouring YouTube for zero-view videos of live performances,
                something has always excited me about sampling.

              <p>
                <span class="drop-cap">T</span>o me, sampling is about more than
                just sound - it's about imbuing your track with traces of the
                feelings, memories, and stories that get immortalized in a piece
                of "complete" music from another time and place. When you sample
                a funk record from 1970s Tehran, you're not just sampling a drum
                beat or a bass-line. You're sampling the story behind the song
                and not just the sounds themselves. This adds a certain
                <i>je-ne-sais-quoi</i> to a track that is difficult, if not
                impossible, to capture by simply playing in the individual parts
                today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since its invention decades go, sampling has been one of the
                best ways to inject history, culture and texture into music but
                it's been severely limited by two inconvenient truths:
              </p>

              1. We can only sample what already exists.<br />
              2. We’re at the mercy of what we can even find.
              <br />

                <img

                  alt="Sample finding illustration"

                />
              </div>
              <h2>UNTIL A.I. CAME ALONG.</h2>

              <p>
                <span class="drop-cap">I</span>n early 2023, I discovered
                technology that allowed me to <i>generate</i> samples based off
                of descriptions - in natural language - of the kinds of genres,
                feelings, and textures I would hunt for in samples. I could
                craft prompts that combined different musical traditions, eras,
                and emotional qualities, I could explore sonic territories that
                had never existed before. These tools became a gateway to
                discovering entirely new musical possibilities. The limitation
                of only being able to sample what existed was suddenly lifted. A
                new frontier of creative possibility had opened up.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since then I've been excitedly exploring how AI can enhance my
                creative process; not as a shortcut or a replacement for my
                artistic expression, but as a way to push the boundaries of what
                I’d known to be possible through sampling. I’ve developed an
                innovative - but incredibly intuitive - approach that combines
                AI’s rapidly evolving capabilities with the timeless soul of
                what makes sampling <i>human</i> music (lol) so special.
              </p>

              <p>
                My approach isn’t about pushing buttons and getting instant
                tracks and it’s definitely not about making AI “do the work for
                me”. It’s about fusing the mind-boggling power of AI with the
                timeless magic of sampling in a way that prioritizes authentic,
                human expression to create beautiful music that moves people.

          <h2>OK. BUT WHAT'S THE POINT?</h2>

          <p>
            <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he point is that it's
            <span class="rainbow-text">fun</span>. I am by no means suggesting
            we replace traditional music production with AI. I'm just excited to
            show you how you can use AI to expand your creative possibilities
            and speed up the ideation process. Think of it like having an
            infinitely large record collection that you can sample from, but one
            where you can describe the feelings or sounds you're looking for.
            The real magic happens when you combine AI-generated elements with
            traditional production techniques, treating AI outputs as raw
            ingredients to be shaped, processed, and transformed.
          </p>

          <p>This approach is particularly powerful for producers who:</p>
          <ul class="point-list">
            <li>
              Love working with samples but want more control over the process
              of finding their source material
            </li>
            <li>
              Want to quickly explore musical combinations that would be
              difficult (or impossible) to create traditionally
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a clear artistic vision but sometimes struggle to find the
              exact sounds they hear in their head
            </li>
            <li>
              Enjoy being surprised and inspired by unexpected - at times random
              - elements in their creative process
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="point-key">
            I cannot reiterate enough:
            <b
              >this is not about pushing a button and getting a finished
              track.</b
            >
            It's about having another powerful tool in your creative arsenal
            that can generate unique starting points for your productions so
            that you can explore and discover and have some fucking fun. The
            real work still lies in your ability to curate, process, and arrange
            these elements into something meaningful and emotionally resonant.
            <u
              >You need to be a skilled producer to get the most out of these
              tools</u

                Every other course will teach basic AI tool usage with the
                promise of 'push-button' music creation - this is not that kind
                of course. There are no shortcuts or magic solutions here. This
                course is built on 15 years of production experience and deep AI
                research, designed for serious producers who want to expand
                their creative possibilities. You'll learn sophisticated
                techniques for transforming AI-generated content into
                professional, emotionally resonant music while maintaining
                artistic integrity. This is about enhancing your existing
                production skills with AI, not replacing them.

                You'll learn advanced prompt engineering, effective stem
                separation techniques, methods for enhancing AI-generated audio
                quality, creative sampling approaches, and my intuitive workflow
                integration. The emphasis is on transforming AI-generated
                content into polished, professional productions through
                intentional processing and creative manipulation -
                <b>not just "generating music with AI"</b>. This is not a basic
                music production course - it's designed to enhance the workflow
                of already experienced producers who enjoy the process of
                sampling.

                Yes - this is absolutely essential. This is not a beginner's
                course or a 'quick fix' solution for making music. You must
                already be comfortable with your DAW and have experience
                producing complete tracks. Required prerequisites include:
                mastery of basic music theory (understanding key signatures,
                chord progressions, and song structure), proficiency with audio
                processing fundamentals, and experience with arrangement and
                mixing. The course assumes you already know how to make music
                and focuses specifically on integrating AI tools into an
                advanced production workflow. If you're new to music production,
                this course is not suitable for you. You should first learn
                traditional production techniques before exploring my AI
                integration.
