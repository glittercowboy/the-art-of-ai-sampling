# TÃ‚CHES Voice & Style Guide

## Core Voice Principles

### Authenticity First
- Lead with real credentials without bragging (71M+ streams mentioned casually)
- Admit limitations openly ("AI-generated audio isn't pristine")
- Share personal journey and genuine excitement about discoveries
- Use conversational language that feels like talking to a friend

### Anti-Sales Approach
- Explicitly acknowledge distaste for "icky" sales tactics
- Respect reader's time with optional "Read More" sections
- No countdown timers, false scarcity, or pressure tactics
- Clear, upfront pricing without psychological manipulation

### Technical Honesty
- Balance technical expertise with accessibility
- Explain complex concepts without dumbing them down
- Be transparent about skill requirements
- Set realistic expectations about AI capabilities

## Language & Tone

### Word Choice
- Mix professional terms with casual expressions
- Occasional strategic profanity for emphasis ("have some fucking fun")
- Technical jargon when necessary, always explained
- Music production terminology used naturally

### Sentence Structure
- Vary between short punchy statements and flowing narrative
- Use parenthetical asides for personal thoughts
- Questions to engage reader thinking
- Lists for clarity when explaining complex topics

### Personality Markers
- Self-deprecating humor ("lol")
- Cultural references (je-ne-sais-quoi)
- Specific details over vague claims
- Personal anecdotes woven throughout

## Content Structure

### Information Architecture
1. Hook with personal story/credibility
2. Optional deep-dive for interested readers
3. Clear value proposition
4. Honest assessment of challenges
5. Specific curriculum details
6. Transparent pricing
7. FAQ addressing real concerns

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clean sections with clear purposes
- Plenty of white space
- Images/GIFs to break up text
- Subtle animations, not flashy effects

## Selling Philosophy

### What TO Do
- Focus on creative possibilities
- Emphasize skill enhancement, not replacement
- Share specific techniques and outcomes
- Build trust through transparency
- Use social proof subtly (label mentions, festival slots)
- Offer genuine value with bonuses

### What NOT to Do

- Avoid "make money fast" implications
- No fake urgency or scarcity
- Don't hide prerequisites or difficulties
- Never exaggerate capabilities
- Avoid generic marketing speak

## Key Messaging Themes

### AI as a Tool
- "Extension of (not replacement for) your creativity"
- Emphasize human artistry remains central
- Compare to having infinite record collection
- Focus on expanding possibilities

### Skill Requirements
- Be upfront about needing production experience
- List specific prerequisites clearly
- Emphasize this enhances existing skills
- Not for beginners - and that's okay

### Creative Philosophy
- Sampling as storytelling, not just sound
- Imbuing tracks with history and emotion
- The "magic" happens in curation and processing
- Fun and experimentation over perfection

## Voice Examples

### Good Examples:
- "I hate icky, never-ending sales pages and want to respect your time."
- "You need to be a skilled producer to get the most out of these tools"
- "The real magic happens when you combine AI-generated elements with traditional production techniques"

### Avoid:
- "Transform your music career overnight!"
- "Anyone can make professional tracks with AI"
- "Limited time offer - act now!"
- "Revolutionary breakthrough system"

## FAQ Approach
- Address real concerns honestly
- Acknowledge limitations upfront
- Provide specific, detailed answers
- No dodging difficult questions
- Include refund policy prominently

## Call-to-Action Style
- Simple, clear buttons ("GET THE COURSE")
- No multiple CTAs pressuring decisions
- Focus on value, not urgency
- Single price point, no upsells

## Overall Philosophy
The landing page should feel like an experienced producer sharing an exciting discovery with fellow musicians, not a marketer trying to make a sale. Every element should reinforce trust, competence, and genuine enthusiasm for the creative possibilities.
