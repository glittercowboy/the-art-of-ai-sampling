Congratulations on completing the art of AI sampling. This has been a hell of a lot of fun. I hope that you've got a lot of value out of the things that we have explored in this course. Obviously, this is such an evolving landscape, as I mentioned in the video when we first jumped into Udio. These things are evolving so quickly, so often. We're getting such crazy new updates every day. I hope that you will understand that this should serve as the beginning of your exploration into the future, of all of the most cutting-edge tools that continue to be coming out. And I hope that this has given you a really good philosophical starting point for how to approach these new technologies in a way that I believe celebrates and uplifts human creativity rather than giving it up, should we say, to the AI swarm megamind. There's just so much that can be done now that we are not bound by not having access to samples or to musicians. The fact that you are now able to just dream up a and vocals. I would have lost my mind and probably just walked into the sea, never to be seen again. But, anyways, I just wanted to say again, thank you so much for taking this course. Please feel free to connect with me, hit me up on all the platforms if you have any questions, if you'd like to connect further on this. And of course, I will be creating more content, probably putting a lot of it out on YouTube as well, as I continue to learn about these new tools.
