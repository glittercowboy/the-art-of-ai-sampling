Okay, so in this first real module, we're going to be diving into a little worksheet that I've put together here called the Artistic Vision Manifesto. And I just want to say up front that this is not homework. You don't need to take this too seriously. It's nothing that you can get wrong. This is really just a vehicle for you to get a little clearer about what it is that you want to create. And I just want to say as well, if there's any questions on here that you don't know how to answer, you just don't want to answer, just delete it. that fucking question. You don't need it. I don't give a shit about that. That's fine. Really, I'm just using this as a tool to help you sort of unpack what it is in your heart and your mind, the other way around, that you would like to see manifest through music. So by all means, don't even use this worksheet. If you can find another way or you already feel that you have a clear understanding of what it is that you want to create and you can use language to do such a thing, then feel free to just skip this module entirely. But for If you are interested in doing my little game, then stick around. Otherwise, skip to the next video. So this worksheet here, the point of it is that when you're using AI tools, because of the fact that the majority of the time the input that you are giving the language model is text, you need to learn how to use language in a way that actually represents what it is that you want. to hear if we don't know what we want to hear. So as just like a brief example, I make house music. You know, I'm known as being a house music producer. But I don't just make house. What is house? House has got a 4-4 kick and it's whatever. If I were to actually try and sit down and describe what the music is that I make, I would say I make house, meditative, introspective, melancholic, nostalgic, textured, lush, rich, I would say western, I would say Indian classical, Hindustani, Carnatic. I would throw all of these terms in that may not be present in every single one of the songs that I make, but if I were to look and I were to feel on a bigger perspective as an artist, like what do I stand for? What is it that I want to create? How would I use language to describe my ideal music that I could create? And so that's what the point of this worksheet is. So I'm not going to harp on too much about this. I'm just going to go through the worksheet with you, just give you some ideas. of how maybe I would answer this, and then what we're gonna do is gonna put it back to you, the ball will be in your court, and then I want for you to fill out this worksheet. But first, let's just run through. So, the first section here, sensory foundations, what emotions form the core of your musical expression? Not just what you feel, but what you want others to feel. So, primary emotional response that you seek to evoke. For example, in me, this would be a feeling of melancholy, of nostalgia. I don't know why it is exactly, but I know that that delicious mix of happy-sad, that kind of comfort with the slight sadness. For me, if I'm making this music and the music that I listen to, I find that I'm able to feel most myself. I'm able to process emotions best if I'm listening to something that puts me in that sort of bittersweet state of just like slight sadness but like happy to be sad. Secondary emotional undertones. Maybe I would like for people to feel empowered, inspired, loved, safe. Emotional journey from and to. to maybe feeling a little lost, to feeling found, to feeling as though they have purpose. So these are the kind of vibes that I'm imagining for you to sit down here is like really think about what are the emotions that you want to express with your music. Because it's not just a case of like, oh, I make good music. What is the good music eliciting? You know, what are the emotional tones that you hope to get out of people? Transformative moment. Feel free to only do a couple of these if you want. You can also add more if you so decide to. You can add another with a cup of coffee or a spliff, is that what you do? And just come up with, or just should we say connect with some of those past moments in your life where you just felt something that you know to this day has changed who you are as a musician. So we're going to fill that in here. Textural vocabulary. This is basically just a dynamic because I think that, you know, things can't be warm and cold at the same time. Maybe they could be in the middle, you know, in which case it's not super warm and it's not super cold. But the point is here, on a scale of warm to cold, warm being one and cold being ten, where would you fall on this scale? I know for a fact that I want to be a one. I want to be full warm. I'm not into the cold sound. What about clarity and distortion? I'd probably say I'm leaning more towards the side of clarity. I want things to be clear. But I like a bit of roughness to some extent, so maybe I'm going to say four. Organic and synthetic. Oh, this is a one. I don't want any of that synthetic stuff. Sparse, dense. This is a tricky one. because I like a bit of both, so I'm gonna say five. Polished, raw, I'm probably gonna go more for say a seven, leaning more towards the raw. Familiar, experimental, I'm gonna say probably three, leaning more towards familiar, even if I am experiencing or exploring some kind of experimental things, I want it to feel nostalgic and familiar in a certain way. And rhythmic and atmospheric, I'm definitely more of a rhythmic person, but I want it to be at least atmospheric, so I'm gonna say four. Anyway, traditional, futuristic, I'm gonna put in one there. So here, what musical traditions resonate with your artistic vision? For me, it's Afro-Latin, Cuban percussion, it's a lot of West African drumming traditions. I love hoodoo music, like the kind of Haitian voodoo kind of ritualistic drumming. I love a lot of like the Yoruba religion drumming. I love Indian classical music, both Hindustani and Carnatic, more of the vocal side. So I'm a big fan of these cultural pieces that even if I'm not sitting down to try and make a piece of... I'm not trying to make specifically a Malian Dogon drum track, but I want elements of that. Like, I know that there's a part of my soul that is deeply moved by that, so I would put that in there. Geographical influences. Definitely South America. Definitely Southern Africa. Very cool. Historic eras that inspired me. Probably, like, the 50s and the 60s. I love like quite in film I love like verbose things so just put that down there what kind of things that are non-musical when I say verbose I mean kind of movies that are just talking you know I oh big fan of that movie uh My Dinner with Andre fucking love that uh hidden inspirations what non-obvious influences shape your life childhood sounds natural environments for me it is definitely like the jungle it's the desert it's the forest it's these dense experiences of nature that just like oh they're in my soul definitely jungle comes through a lot in my music. It's definitely desert. I actually hadn't experienced the jungle until a year ago where I moved here in Costa Rica. But it's funny, I'd been yearning for the jungle in the music that I made for like 10-12 years. I'd been making music that felt like it would fit in the jungle. Also hidden inspirations, childhood sounds. Oh, the sound of rain on the roof. I had this memory of being with my parents when I was probably about five and there was a very heavy rainstorm when we lived in London when I was a kid. And we had this little glass-roofed conservatory out back of the house. And I guess the rain was so heavy, such a big storm, that it woke me up. And my parents came and they took me downstairs and we sat in this glass-roofed conservatory in the middle of a crazy rainstorm. And we ate cereal. And I remember just having this kind of feeling of coziness and warmth of being with my parents and hearing that just drum of the rain on the roof. And I love incorporating rain into my tracks now, and it always takes me back to that feeling. I have a very complex interplay between sounds. It's very dense. I'm a big maximalist. Recurring thematic ideas. I guess a feeling of kind of like ritual, of prayer, of sacredness, of prayer through music. Sonic fingerprints you want to develop. For me, that's definitely percussion. It's like having a drum sound that just makes you, oh, you can't help but move. What musical territories do you feel drawn to but haven't yet ventured into? For me, this is properly like gospel. I've touched on it, I've explored it a little bit, but I love those rich, thick gospel choirs, and I would love to work with a gospel choir to have that just richness, and AI is a really great way of being able to explore some of these things that cost a lot of money to do, like if you want to go and do an actual orchestral piece recording with a real choir, not a real choir, a real orchestra, it's going to cost you a hell of a lot of money, so these kind of things are very cool, like what else? Well, I'd actually really like to do a little bit of kind of like surf rock as well maybe. Okay, creative boundaries. I will never include these elements in my music. I will never include like digital synths. Like I will never include like a vowel morph wob, like a dubstep sound. I'll also never include in my music like broken beat drums. They just don't move me. I want like a steady, hypnotic, trippy, rhythmic 4-4 rhythm. I'm willing to experiment with, let's say, what am I willing to do? to experiment with. Maybe like auto-tuned vocals. Potentially. Actually, not really. I'm going to put that in my never-include list. But anyway, you get the idea. I always want my music to contain meaning, purpose. I always want it to contain some element of truth from historical cultural folk traditions. Okay, artistic manifesto. Complete these statements. If my music were a landscape, it would be a dense, rich, natural expanse with jungles and deserts and rivers and mountains and snow and rain. The feeling of my music is like when you come home to yourself, when you find that strength in the darkest moments, in the moments when you feel hopeless and all of a sudden you just feel as though you're the strongest that you could ever be. My music exists to shine a light on the darkness. My music exists to provide strength when we feel weak. People will listen to my music when they want to find purpose, when they want to find meaning. "Capture the Essence of Your Musical Vision" in a concise, powerful statement that could guide all of your creative decisions. I want to make music that celebrates where we have come from as the human race. I want to make music that celebrates the feelings that we often are afraid to explore. I want to make music that lifts humanity up to make them feel..." Sorry about that, the gardener just turned up. "I want to make humans feel safe, to feel strong, to feel capable, to feel curious, to feel excited, to feel in love with their experience of being here. I should probably do it. In 20 years, what do you want people to say about your body of work? That it was true, that it was honest, that it was pure, that it reflected what it was that I was intending. We'll see how that works. Create vocabulary pairs that will help you translate feelings into prompt. Feeling quality. This is an interesting one. Feeling or quality, I would say nostalgic. descriptive language I would use potentially just other kind of synonyms for that so maybe I would put in bittersweet there's a bunch of terms from places around the world like zensucht in Germany mono no aware in Japan saudade from from Portugal and a lot of these words I think could be summed up in all of the songs that I that I've made a lot of them have these characteristics of just like a oh just this this to look at the pain in one's heart. So example in music, I would say a lot of kind of traditional Portuguese fardo music. I would say there's a lot of that in a lot of kind of 50s classical, not classical, 50s classic country music. There is just this like, this honesty with the pain that one feels. So I would go in there, do that. What about ideal sounds using non-musical senses? Colors. I would put in pastel, but I would put in vibrant. I would say "sandy, dusty, crunchy, crispy." "Movement, smooth and flowing." "Repetitive, hypnotic." "Tactile, how would it feel to touch?" I guess "textures" here as well. I would say it would probably feel... it would feel furry. It would feel smooth. It would feel gentle. It wouldn't feel wet. It would feel woody. "Taste, smells." Oh, it would be spicy. It would be salty. "Scentes." It would be "oodie." All of these just delicious terms. So anyway, the point of this worksheet is to get you to just really brain dump down a bunch of words here. Please fill in as much as you can and really then end up with something that even if it takes you a little 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes, try and put as many words in as you can. Even if it doesn't necessarily feel 100% that you're sticking to the worksheet, just generate a bunch of words. And I'm going to ask you to pause the video now. is paused. Well, actually I should have explained this before I told you to pause it, but pause the video and I want you to go in, fill this worksheet, and when you are done come back to me and we shall continue on with the next part of this. Cool, so I hope that you now have a fully filled out worksheet and that you are ready to rock and roll because what I'm going to ask you to now do is copy and paste everything that you've done. So I probably should actually have a version here that is filled out. I'm just going to do something off screen to make this a little bit more fun for us. Here we go. So I'm going to pretend I've got a filled out one here. I'm going to pretend that we now have a filled out document and I'm going to ask you to go to Claude or ChatGPT or whatever it is that you tend to use. Let me just make myself a little bit smaller here. Whatever AI tool that you use, whether it is ChatGPT, whether it's Grok, whatever, I want you to go in there and then you're going to I think 200 and 250 is pretty good. And then nice. All we're going to do now is delete this. And then we're going to copy and paste in our actual response. Which let me just pull it off again the screen because I have this here. Artistic Vision Manifesto. Okay, cool. We're back. So we're going to take this and all I'm going to do is copy and paste the actual form in. For goodness sake, what is going on here? Oh, there we go. I have actually put it in a bunch of times. I've put it in loads of times. Or of course we could use ChatGPT if that's something that you would like to do. So let's put this up here. Here is the response that I've got. You know nostalgia, gentle melancholy blah blah blah blah blah. I'm just going to copy and paste that down here. Make a little separator and then I'm going to copy in the same prompt that we had in the other one. So let's just put that in there and then let's just see what happens. So here I put in Gimnopedy number one. Fucking love that. And we're just gonna pull up here to see what we get. Nice. So it's given us just a giant bunch of words and adjectives. Now this is gonna be very handy as we move forward because these are words that either we have actually included or it's extracted from that with some sort of connection to the words. Let's go back to ChatGPT to see what it's done as well. Similar things. Introspective, Cathartic, Melancholic, Lovely. This is not actually my response. this was I got AI to actually fill out the sheet for us. I'm not a big fan of IDM, but I am a big fan of a lot of these things. So what we can now do, and I want to suggest that as we move through the rest of this course, you are by all means able to utilize your brain to come up with prompts as you see fit. In a given moment, feel free to just use your brain to come up with words. However, there is something quite nice about having a list of words that you are able to to pick from without having to consistently come up with these ideas on the spot. So what I'm going to suggest is that we now copy and paste these words and I have here a website that I have created that you will be able to use that will also be in the show notes so to speak and all you're going to do is go down here and click edit tags and you can actually just delete all of these tags in here. This is, if you're interested, every single genre tag on Wikipedia. So if you were interested in just using those you can. But what we're going to do is just delete all of those in there and we're just going to paste in our prompts or the specific words that we've put in. We're going to click Save and now all we need to do in any given moment to get a prompt that is a variation of this is we just click Generate and it will give us a list of things. Do we like the sound of any of these? Oh yeah, I mean I quite like the idea of minimal percussion, maybe soft. Generate again. What have we got here? cinematic, ambient longing. Go on then. And you just lock them, of course, and when you do this you're then able to come up with a prompt up here that all you do is slightly warm, take that as well. And you just click this and this is now going to copy and paste that to your clipboard. And as you're going to see in the next video now all we need to do is chuck in a prompt and you can go back and forth as many times as you want. Maybe I'm actually going to take these ones as well. And you can start to fill out as many as you want in the random tag or as I said if you don't want to have to use another bloody AI tool because god forbid we think for ourselves just do it your way but just wanted to give you this option it's a really nice easy way of coming up with prompts because you get to say do I want this yeah subtle synths modern textural ambient loops slow muffled voices and you know one more we'll do subtle rhythms cool so I could take that and that would probably be a pretty nice prompt but once you've done this you are Now ready to continue on with this course and jump into why you're really here, which is generating a bunch of fucking sick music with AI and then creating cool tracks with it. So I shall see you in the next video. Thank you so much. And I look forward to exploring this wild frontier with you.
