# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a website for "The Art of AI Sampling with TÃ‚CHES" - a landing page for a course about using AI tools for music production. 

**Current State**: Static website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
**Target State**: Next.js application with integrated Stripe checkout and Facebook CAPI tracking

The main components are:
- `index.html`: The single-page website structure
- `styles.css`: All styling for the website
- `script.js`: JavaScript for interactive elements (typing animation, FAQ accordion, etc.)
- `/images/`: Directory containing all images used on the website
- `plan.md`: Detailed implementation plan for Stripe integration project

## Website Architecture

The website follows a simple structure:
- Header section with logo and introduction
- Main content sections:
  - Introduction with expandable "Read More" content
  - Course overview with cards for different modules
  - Information about the purpose of the course
  - Pricing and enrollment section
  - Notes about AI music quality
  - FAQ section

## Development Workflow

### Current Static Site (Pre-Migration)

To view the current static website locally:
```bash
# Using Python's built-in HTTP server
python -m http.server

# OR using Node's http-server if installed
npx http-server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Planned Next.js Application (Post-Migration)

Once migrated to Next.js (see plan.md), development commands will be:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- payment.test.js

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production build locally
npm start
```

### Stripe Integration Testing

For payment testing during development:
```bash
# Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to local development
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook

# Test with Stripe test card numbers
# 4242424242424242 (Visa)
# 4000000000000002 (Card declined)
```

## Development Memories

- Don't try to run the server. I will run it with npm run dev myself
- You must ALWAYS test and confirm tests pass before moving on to the next task.

## Design Guidelines

When making changes to the website, follow these principles from the `website-design-brief.md`:

- Use clean, minimalist design that prioritizes readability and content hierarchy
- Maintain a flowing, natural reading experience
- Include plenty of white space to let content breathe
- Use the established muted, professional color palette
- Preserve the subtle animated transitions
- Present information in a logical, structured way
- Maintain clear content sections with intuitive navigation

Avoid:
- Aggressive marketing tactics or psychological triggers
- Countdown timers or artificial scarcity indicators
- High-pressure sales language or bold claims
- Pop-ups or intrusive elements
- Bright, attention-grabbing colors
- Unnecessary decorative elements

## Style Guide

### Typography
- Primary headings: "Poppins", sans-serif
- Monospace text: "Cutive Mono", monospace
- Body text: "Inter", sans-serif

### Colors
- Primary accent: #e6ac55
- Text color: #000000
- Background: #f0f0f0
- Subtle background: #f9f9f9
- Card background: #f7f7f7
- Muted text: #666

These values are defined as CSS variables in `styles.css` and should be referenced rather than using hard-coded values.

## Content Tone

Content updates should maintain the established tone:
- Conversational and authentic voice
- Specific, concrete details
- Technical terminology where appropriate
- Professional but approachable tone
- Transparent about limitations and requirements

Avoid:
- Marketing buzzwords
- Exaggerated claims
- High-pressure language
- Artificial urgency
- Unnecessary hype

## Project Implementation Context

This repository is transitioning from a static site to a Next.js application with integrated payments. See `plan.md` for the complete implementation roadmap.

### Key Integration Requirements

**Payment Processing**: 
- Stripe Elements embedded on taches.ai domain (not redirected)
- Single $98 payment for course access
- Professional checkout UX replacing current GHL redirect

**Tracking & Analytics**:
- Facebook Pixel (browser-side) + Facebook CAPI (server-side)
- Event deduplication to prevent double-counting
- Target: >8.0 Event Match Quality score for ad optimization

**CRM Integration**:
- Webhook to GHL for automated course access
- Direct HTTP POST to GHL inbound webhook URL
- Retry logic for webhook reliability

### Critical Architecture Decisions

1. **Single-Domain Tracking**: Everything happens on taches.ai to eliminate cross-domain attribution issues
2. **TDD Approach**: Every feature must have passing tests before implementation
3. **Minimal Complexity**: Use simplest solutions that meet requirements
4. **Production Ready**: Built for Facebook ad campaigns with reliable conversion tracking

When working on this project, always reference `plan.md` for detailed implementation steps and maintain the established design aesthetic while adding new functionality.
